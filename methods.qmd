## Generating a list of biotech companies
A preliminary list was generated by using a combination of Google search and the startups supported by the Oregon Bioscience Incubator.
The coordinates were generating using a website, [GPS Coordinate Converter](https://gps-coordinates.org/coordinate-converter.php), that converts an input address into a set of longitude and latitude coordinates.
Information about each company was gathered on their respective website.

## Creating a map
In creating a map, a series of video tutorials were used to create an outline of the map. The assistance of Claude AI was used to create the interactive radio buttons for different biotech specialties.

## Updating the map
This site may be updated by accessing a master spreadsheet. Using GitHub Actions, the site will automatically update at 6 AM UTC.
