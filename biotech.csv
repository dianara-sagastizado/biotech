AgonOX,https://www.agonox.com/,2012,At AgonOx we believe a cure for many types of cancer will be found through harnessing the power of the immune system. Within all tumors there exists a diverse mix of immune cells. In particular our company is interested in T cells and their function within tumor-bearing hosts. Some of these T cells are responding to new or overly expressed antigens that a tumor produces and are capable of destroying the tumor. Others are actively shutting down the immune response to protect healthy tissue. This dynamic and complex relationship is ongoing in the tumor microenvironment and is unique relative to blood.  ,,andrew.weinberg@agonox.com,,4805 NE Glisan St,,Portland,Oregon,97213,Immunotherapy,4805 NE Glisan St  Portland Oregon 97213,-122.6138661,45.527888
